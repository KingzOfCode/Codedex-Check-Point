# Codedex-Check-Point
Rock✊🪨 , Paper✋📄, Scissors✌ ✂️

I like how this project incorporated control flow and comparisons.  I was trying to do some nesting to make it cleaner, but that didn't work out.  I think it can be done, so I have more to learn (goes without saying...).  
The most challenging thing was trying to reduce the lines of code.  I made sure to use the "else" to delete lines of code for cases of a tie game.  I was able to complete Rock, Paper, Scissors without the AI Bot! I did refer to previous lessons i completed and I got it right (I think)!!
I will definitely be doing the other projects. I hope i can submit those too. 😁

Checkpoint Project
I will be submitting my first project today.
